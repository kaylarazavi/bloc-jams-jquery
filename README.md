# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app

BlocJams is a project in which I created a jQuery-driven music player web application where I accomplished the following:

- [x] use jQuery to insert album title and album art information into the DOM
- [x] use jQuery to add functionality to play and navigate between playing songs
- [x] use jQuerty to add functionality to add previous and next song buttons
- [x] display time in minutes:seconds format
- [x] use jQuery to enable volume slider
- [x] use jQuery to enable play time slider

[BlocJams is hosted on Netlify and can be viewed here](https://kaylaraz-blocjams.netlify.com/).
